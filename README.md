Hello! I'm Harneet, a graduate student specializing in the application of machine learning to solve real-world problems. 
My primary focus is on Natural Language Processing and building effective Recommendation Systems.
I am a dedicated problem-solver with a strong foundation in statistical analysis and a passion for turning complex data into actionable insights.
My core technical skills include Python, SQL, Scikit-learn, and libraries for building NLP and recommender models.

**What I'm Currently Working On**
ðŸ”¬ Capstone Project: Developing an NLP classifier to detect depression from social media text, focusing on nuanced model evaluation for sensitive applications.
ðŸš€ Recommendation Systems: Exploring hybrid recommendation techniques and the use of LLMs to enhance content-based filtering and mitigate the cold-start problem.

**My Goals**
To continuously build a portfolio of impactful data science projects.
To secure a challenging AI/ML internship where I can apply my skills to real-world data challenges.
To contribute to open-source projects in the machine learning space.
